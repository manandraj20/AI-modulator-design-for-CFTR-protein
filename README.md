# AI-modulator-design-for-CFTR-protein
We design novel modulator molecules for CFTR that binds to the defective CFTR at the cell surface and opens the chloride channel (holds the gate open) so that chloride can flow through, regulating the amount of fluids at the surface of the cell. This helps in controlling the symptoms of cystic fibrosis.
